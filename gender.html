		<span class="keyword">Hello!</span><br><br>
		<span class="bright">As you now know, I'm actually female. I'll keep this short, because this is a bit of an awkwardly personal subject to talk about, but there are some things I want you to keep in mind:</span><br><br>
		<ul><li class="keyword">I'm still the exact same person as I was last year. Now you just know more about me.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Please try to refer to me as a girl and use she/her/hers pronouns. Also please avoid treating me as if I were male because I'm not.</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Estrogen doesn't change voice, which means that I have to do voice coaching to have a voice that sounds like I want it to. Voice coaching is hard. Please understand that my voice won't sound female for a noticeable amount of the time.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">I don't particularly want to make a big deal out of this, because it's not. Please don't make it a bigger deal than it needs to be.</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Watch out for stereotypes. I'm not particularly feminine. Cis girls are sometimes the same way but sometimes people think (unhelpfully) that trans people should be in a smaller range of gender expression.</li></ul>
		<br>
		<span class="bright">If you have any questions, you can ask Veronica or Aline, and if you know me at least decently well, you can email me directly.</span><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="bright">Cheers,</span><br>
