### Wrapped Drawing

Hi!

Remember the issues with expensive contracts?

The worst part was this:

    (Instance DC<%>)

To solve the problem (mostly), I extracted a separate untyped file that would wrap all of the drawing operations, so that none of the expensive interfaces would be typechecked.

I correspondingly wrapped everything in opaque types:

    (require/typed "wrap-draw.rkt"
                   [#:opaque ColorInst wd:color?]
                   [#:opaque PenInst wd:pen?]
                   [#:opaque BrushInst wd:brush?]
                   [#:opaque Context wd:context?]

I tested the relative timing by thunking out the main code (wrapping it in a thunk call), which would run everything except actually running the program.

Original:

    real	0m34.283s
    user	0m33.503s
    sys	0m0.847s

Modified:

    real	0m19.052s
    user	0m18.343s
    sys	0m0.747s

Hooray! That's nearly half the typechecking time chopped off.
