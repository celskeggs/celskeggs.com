### Project Plan!

Hello!

This blog is about Scribbles (final name pending), a computer science project about computer art.

Not art as in fractals or anything, but rather art as in illustration art as would be drawn by a human using a computer.

Here's an example of what I mean (a stick figure drawn by my current early prototype):

![Stick figure](/images/stickfigure.png)

And with the handles visible:

![Stick figure 2](/images/stickfigure2.png)

As an example, take a look at [this speedpaint from an artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZfhxiMXHQk).
That should make the (very approximate) art style clear; and examples like that of how humans can draw will be very useful - to draw like a human, one should probably use techniques used by humans.

**This is an extremely difficult idea!** I find it likely that I may fail, but I do understand that. In any case, it'll be an interesting learning experience!

Let's see where this goes.

Cheers,
