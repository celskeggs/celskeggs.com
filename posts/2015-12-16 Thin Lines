### Line variance

With a bit of work on posing, the feet started to look a bit better:

But I've digressed slightly to take care of line widths: note how that third small character has overly thick lines, since they aren't varied with scale.

To fix this, I changed the pen styles to be dynamically generated based on both scale and style, not just style:

Another example:

The line width variance helped, but it probably needs to have a smarter nonlinear system.

(The feet still need some more work too.)
