### Splines! (Minipost)

![Box figure 20](/images/boxfigure20.png)

These actually weren't that hard! However, I'm not completely satisfied with these - the lengths of the splines are preserved properly. Just look at those arms.

(Behind the scenes, I also abstracted out the limb handling code so that I didn't duplicate it across right-arm vs left-arm, which will come in handy once I start using it for legs too.)

I might want to try writing my own spline-handling code, but I'm not sure if that would be efficient enough compared to what's probably GPU-rendered splines.

Cheers, Colby Skeggs.
