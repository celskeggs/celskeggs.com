### Optimizations! (minipost)

Hello!

Latest work: after a bunch of optimizations, involving a bunch of type specifying and other things according to the optimization helper, the lag in the viewer is much improved!

Specifically, the system now doesn't slow down at all, until the seventh figure, whereas the earlier version slowed significantly down at the third figure.

The old version became annoyingly slow here:

The new version got up to eight figures before being annoyingly slow:

I do plan to make this even better shortly, before I move on. Also, I may take a divergence to see if I can optimize Typed Racket's typechecking at all.

Cheers,
