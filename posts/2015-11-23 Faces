### More faces! (Minipost)

I also fixed a bug causing the face to disappear in rare occasions, and a bug preventing me from saving any patterns with an 'n' in a setting name.

The ability to switch between faces also required some more rendering infrastructure.

Also, I figured out that running my program from the shell is slightly faster to typecheck than running it from DrRacket.
