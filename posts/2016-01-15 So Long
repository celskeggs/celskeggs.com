### So Long!

We're now at the end of the semester, and I've been given a choice: continue with this project for another semester, or try something else?

I've decided to switch to a different project. Why? This project has been very interesting, but I haven't been learning as much as I could have.
I'm going to focus on something that will, in and of itself, teach me something.

Still, I've wrapped up my work on this project, and it's a usable version! See the link at the end of this post for the downloadable version.

I'll be posting a link to my blog for the next project shortly.

Cheers, Colby Skeggs.

The current version of my code is [v0.2.0](https://github.com/col6y/scribbles/releases/tag/v0.2.0): cd6b807311b9f373f80e418f186d74e572d890a9.
