### Spline Legs! (Minipost)

![Box figure 22](/images/boxfigure22.png)

This change actually involved removing code, rather than adding it! (Because now it can share the same code as the arms.)

However, I'm not completely sure that I like it better like this.

I might revisit this decision later.

Cheers, Colby Skeggs.
