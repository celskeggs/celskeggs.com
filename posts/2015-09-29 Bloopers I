### Bloopers I (minipost)

I made some mistakes with a different model...

And then finally got something slightly better:

This is supposed to vaguely mimic the original art style of [the OOTS comics](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html). These are a lot simpler than some of what I plan to get to, but require more advanced techniques than the stick figures.
