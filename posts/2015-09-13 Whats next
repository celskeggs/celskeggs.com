### What's next? *(an addendum to 'Typed Racket!')*

Some of my next steps include:

*   **Perspective!**

    Currently, sizing is based on fixed bone lengths.
    This would be accurate if the characters lived in Flatland, but they're *supposed* to look slightly 3d-ish.

*   **More settings!**

    It needs to be possible to edit options and settings (such as sizing or character-specific changes) in a way that isn't just dragging handles.

*   **Saving and loading!**

    Currently, everything gets lost when you close the program. You *can* save *images*, but that's not the same.

*   **Multiple characters!**

    Nothing you actually want to draw has only a single stick figure! I need to be able to put multiple on a canvas.

Cheers,
