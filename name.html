		<span class="keyword">Hello everyone!</span><br><br>
		<span class="bright">I'm trying out a new name! Instead of "Colby T. Skeggs", it's "Cel A. Skeggs".</span><br><br>
		<span class="keyword">This is almost certainly (as in, 90% certain) a permanent change, so I'm expecting you to switch over. Thank you very much!</span><br><br>
		<span class="bright">Frequently asked questions about this name:</span><br><br>
		<ul>
		<li class="keyword">Q: How do you pronounce "Cel"?<br>Cel is pronounced /s…õl/ as in Cell.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Q: What does "Cel" mean? Is it short for anything?<br>"Cel" is short for "Cell", a reference to both computer science AND biology. :D</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Q: What if I mess up and say "Colby" instead?<br>Just correct yourself and move on. I know that this feels hard, but just keep at it.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Q: What does the "A." stand for?<br>I'm not entirely certain yet. Ask me again in a month or so.</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Q: Are you changing your name legally?<br>Yes, after I make a college decision. It's much easier if I don't have to update it during application processing.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Q: Who knows about this? Do I need to keep this private?<br>Various people know. Assume that they do: just say "Cel", and if someone doesn't recognize the name, you can clarify that "Cel used to be named Colby."</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Q: Do I need to start sending emails to a new address?<br>I'm still skeggsc, since my first initial stays the same.</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Q: Am I allowed to make puns about your name?<br>Absolutely. I was very Cel-ective in choosing this name.</li><br>
		<li class="keyword">Q: Why did you change your name?<br>Because I could. Also because "Colby" is gendered as male too often. (Not that Cel will necessarily not be, but it's much more ambiguous.)</li><br>
		<li class="bright">Q: Why does your name still show up as "Colby" on your email?<br>I haven't changed it yet in the Catlin system. There are some complications with transcripts being sent to college that I want to resolve before changing it.</li><!-- <br> -->
		<!-- <li class="bright">Q: Isn't it ironic that this is hosted on colbyskeggs.com?<br>It was ironic, but then I got a new domain name.</li> -->
		</ul>
